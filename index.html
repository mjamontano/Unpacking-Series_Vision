    <tr><td>We are unpacking <b>"vision"</b> - because using your gifts to move our business forward in the right direction is essential to long-term success for you and the company.<br><br><img src="i1.png"><br><br>For organizations of every size and type, a well-articulated vision helps everyone involve understand and embrace the organization's purpose and direction.<br><br>A vision is not a grand plan; rather, it provides direction and general guidance about the opportunities the organization will and will not pursue. A good vision helps create the conditions where a bottom-up approach can flourish - where all members understand how to contribute and cooperate to create virtuous cycles of mutual benefit.<br><br><img src="i2.png"><br><br><b>Consider:</b><br>Read the <b>Organization Vision Statement</b>. What two or three points stand out to you?<br>What is the vision for your team? Regardless of whether your team has a written vision statement or not, you should be clear about how your team advances your site, business unit, or company vision.<br><br><b>Resource:</b><br><br><a href="d1.pdf" target="_blank">PBM Organization Vision</a><br><br><b>Bottom-Up vs Top-Down</b><br><b>What is Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down?</b><br>This principle helps us understand the fundamental approach we want to take (bottom-up) by contrasting it with what we don’t want (top-down).<br><br>A bottom-up approach respects the inherent worth of each person and unleashes creativity, initiative and talents, resulting in beneficial outcomes beyond what anyone could have planned or predicted.<br><br>A top-down approach assumes those in control know what’s best for everyone else. Those at the top typically seek power, rely on one-size-fits-all approaches and use detailed rules and coercion that stifle others. No matter how well-intentioned, a top-down approach only benefits those at the top.<br><br><b>Why is This Important?</b><br>Only in a bottom-up society or organization can individuals more fully apply their abilities and knowledge to better their lives and the lives of others. Taking a bottom-up approach to all we do is essential for respecting individuals, applying our principles, and empowering individuals throughout the organization to use their gifts and knowledge to tackle problems and pursue opportunities.<br><br><b>Principle in Brief: Bottom-Up vs Top-Down</b><br>For all the millennia of human existence, life was miserable. Nearly everyone was born into poverty, lived in poverty and died young. As recently as 200 years ago, 90% of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. But then something remarkable began to happen: life started to get better and better for more and more people. The flat line representing average well-being became a hockey stick, suddenly and sharply improving – and it has not stopped. Today, less than 10 percent of people live in extreme poverty, even though the world’s population is now almost eight times what it was 200 years ago.<br><br>What happened? In short, certain societies haltingly but increasingly began to move from top-down – where a few people controlled the many – to bottom-up, where more and more people enjoyed greater opportunity to live as they saw fit, although it has been an uneven process that remains incomplete. They were more fully able to apply their abilities and knowledge to better their lives and the lives of others.<br><br>A top-down approach assumes those in control know what’s best for everyone else. Those at the top typically seek power, rely on one-size-fits-all approaches and use detailed rules and coercion that stifle others. No matter how well-intentioned, a top-down approach only benefits those at the top.<br><br>A bottom-up approach respects the inherent worth of each person and unleashes creativity, initiative and talents, resulting in beneficial outcomes beyond what anyone could have planned or predicted. People and society benefit when behavior is mostly governed by general principles rather than detailed rules, freeing individuals to use their gifts and knowledge to tackle problems and pursue opportunities.<br><br>In an organization, a bottom-up approach does not mean decentralizing all decisions or equally distributing authorities. Leaders play a vital role in making decisions for which they have the comparative advantage. For example, a facility manager is most likely in the best position to make decisions that affect the whole facility. With a bottom-up approach, the manager seeks and uses the input and challenge of those who have relevant knowledge. However, with a top-down approach, managers simply impose their decisions, which undermines the culture and leads to worse results. They are guilty of “the fatal conceit.”<br><br>Bottom-up does not mean employees are free to do whatever they feel like. We strive to create the conditions where employees are motivated to do what is beneficial for organization and themselves. The responsibility of every supervisor is to enable their employees to understand how, and be motivated, to maximize value in harmony with our principle-based framework. This bottom-up approach benefits everyone – employees, organization, and society.<br><br><br><b>Examples</b><br>The following workplace examples contrast the mindset and behaviors of individuals when they take a bottom-up approach compared to a top-down approach.<br><br><b>Making Decisions</b><br><b>Bottom-Up Approach</b>: Max’s team has three different alternatives for how to make a web-based application more user-friendly. Max gathers a focus group of customers to get their reactions and feedback. He also listens to his team’s recommendation and asks them questions to understand their reasoning. Max realizes this decision will affect other teams, so he works with those leaders to make sure the final decision leads to the best overall outcome.<br><br><b>Top-Down Approach</b>: Max’s team has three different alternatives for how to make a web-based application more user-friendly. Because he became team lead after a decade of doing product development, Max believes he understands what customers value. Since there’s no clear "winning” alternative based on net present value or other financial calculations, he chooses the alternative he prefers.<br><br><b>Working with Others</b><br><b>Bottom-Up Approach</b>: When Bree is asked to give her perspective about her teammate, Donny, leading a large project, she gives her honest opinion about his skills and where he might need help. She sees Donny’s potential and is excited to help him. Bree embraces this as a chance to develop her coaching and mentoring skills.<br><br><b>Top-Down Approach</b>: When Bree is asked to give her perspective about her teammate, Donny, leading a large project, she downplays Donny’s gifts and potential. Bree views Donny as a threat and doesn’t want to do anything that might take away from her own status.<br><br><b>Leading Others</b><br><b>Bottom-Up Approach</b>: While Sara’s team has developed various work processes and procedures, she consistently focuses her team on results and uses principles to describe what good looks like. She coaches her team members to be more contribution motivated and encourages them to continually find ways to improve their processes and identify work that should be stopped.<br><br><b>Top-Down Approach</b>: Sara spends most of her energy developing and enforcing the processes and procedures she created for her team. She views herself as the expert and her team as the “workers” who just need to do what she tells them. The team has created workarounds when the processes don’t do well because it’s easier than dealing with Sara to get something changed. They know Sara doesn’t view them as worthy of contributing to team-level ideas or decisions.<br><br><b>Dealing with Change</b><br><b>Bottom-Up Approach</b>: Juan works at a site that is going through a lot of changes. The plant leadership team recently held a townhall meeting to talk about changing market conditions, the company’s updated vision and the site’s priorities. After the meeting, Juan talks to his supervisor and asks questions to better understand the reason for the changes. He then offers specific ideas for what their team could do differently to improve results.<br><br><b>Top-Down Approach</b>: Juan works at a site that is going through a lot of changes. The plant leadership team recently held a townhall meeting to talk about changing market conditions, the company’s updated vision and the site’s priorities. After the meeting, Juan says to his supervisor, “They spend so much time explaining why this place is always changing. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.”</td></tr>

    <tr><td><img src="i3.png"><br><br>Leaders can develop an incredible, transformative vision, but the organization won't realize the benefits of that vision if it's not a <b>SHARED VISION</b>!<br><br>Your team has a shared vision when every team member understands what the organization is trying to achieve, knows how they can best contribute, and is motivated to do it. A shared vision help you <b>"row the team boat"</b> in the same direction.<br><br><img src="i4.png"><br><br>While there won't always be smooth sailing, here are few signs that your team has a shared vision:<br><br>1) Everyone understands and is aligned with what team success looks like.<br>2) Everyone on the team knows who your customers (and potential customers) are.<br>3) There is a high degree of cooperation and collaboration toward common objectives.<br>4) You recognize the partnerships your team needs to be successful.<br>5) Your team knows how mutual benefit improves outcomes for all parties involved, fostering enduring partnerships.<br>6) Team members engage in respectful challenge to innovate and improve results.<br><br><b>Consider:</b><br><br>Discuss with your supervisor or your entire team: Who does your team create value for? How does your team create value? Is there a common, shared understanding? If not, who can help your team reach a shared vision?<br>Try describing your vision, in simple terms, to a friend or family member. What does this experience reveal about your understanding of the vision?<br><br><b>Resources:</b><br><br><b>Motivation</b><br><b>Principles in Brief: Motivation</b><br>Motivation (from the Latin word meaning “to move”) is what prompts us to act. It is not a feeling, emotion or what makes a person happy. A person’s motivation comes from a combination of what is within them (intrinsic) and their environment (extrinsic). Thus, to have an organization of contribution-motivated people, we address both factors.<br><br>We start by selecting contribution-motivated employees who define success as making a positive difference for others and have a strong desire to do so (intrinsic). We then strive to select supervisors who will create an environment (extrinsic) that motivates employees to maximize their contributions to organization’s long-term success. We reward results rather than activity; otherwise, we unintentionally motivate employees to do work that is wasteful.<br><br>We also recognize that for individuals to act, they not only need to be dissatisfied with the status quo, they need to have a vision of a better state and a belief it can be achieved.Just as profit and loss can help satisfy these three conditions for entrepreneurs, roles, feedback and rewards can help satisfy these conditions for employees.<br><br>Rather than using rigid, formulaic pay structures that fail to consider what an individual has contributed (whether positive or negative), we attempt to reward employees according to the long-term value they create. This includes contributions to culture, current results and building capabilities that we believe will generate results. When employees understand how they earned and can increase their compensation, they become more fully motivated to increase their contributions.<br><br>Effective supervisors are motivated to help their employees self-actualize, rather than control and stifle them. They prioritize building trusted relationships and learning how to motivate each employee based on what is important to them, given their subjective value – such as pay, doing meaningful work they are good at and care about, having some control over their activities, and the opportunity to be creative and develop.<br><br><br><b>Principles in Brief: Alignment of Incentives</b><br>Organization’s future depends on providing incentives that motivate our core constituencies to help maximize the company’s long-term success.<br><br>This starts with our employees. We seek to align their interests with what will be beneficial for them and organization in harmony with our principle-based framework. This alignment provides roles, work, authorities and rewards that motivate them to make the maximum contributions to their organization and ultimately to organization’s long-term success. This includes contributions in building capabilities that have generated or we believe will generate results – including past contributions that haven’t been fully rewarded. And we don’t penalize well-designed experiments that fail, because they create knowledge leading to better decisions.<br><br>We structure incentives to align the interests of employees with the interests of the company, our customers and society.  As psychologist Abraham Maslow taught, “This includes the need for meaningful work, for responsibility, for creativeness, for being fair and just, for doing what is worthwhile, and for [doing] it well.” Employees also need to feel they are working for a good company and are benefiting others as well as themselves.<br><br>Additional key aspects include:<br><br>Using incentives to guide employees toward activities and areas where their abilities and interests will enable them to create the most value<br>Structuring incentives to attract, motivate and retain principled entrepreneurs, without putting a limit on compensation<br>Basing compensation on overall contribution to organization’s long-term success, not just on a specific set of accomplishments<br>Rewarding contributions, such as knowledge sharing, that benefit other employees and parts of organization<br>Aligning incentives starts with eliminating perverse incentives – those that cause employees to sub-optimize their ability to create value or even to destroy value.<br><br>Examples of perverse incentives are:<br><br>One-size-fits-all point systems or pay grades, detailed formulas, profit sharing and cost-of-living adjustments, regardless of an individual’s contribution<br>Automatic raises and pay based on title, credentials, seniority, experience or number of reports<br>Rewarding short-term earnings or the performance of the employee’s unit regardless of the effect on organization’s long-term success<br>Financial compensation for hitting targets that aren’t tied to value creation, such as meeting budgets or exceeding sales goals<br><br>It is also important to align incentives for the company’s other core constituencies, such as customers, suppliers, shareholders, co-investors, communities and governments. Doing so by understanding their subjective values greatly enhances organization’s long-term success.<br><br>Some examples:<br>By consistently practicing stewardship and compliance – especially regarding safety and the environment – providing good jobs and supporting effective non-profits, we make our communities better and they will want us to succeed<br>Persuading retailers to increase our premium shelf space by demonstrating that our products will improve store traffic<br>Motivating our suppliers to create the most value for us by empowering and rewarding them appropriately<br>Designing the compensation for advisors, agents or consultants to share in our gain so they are motivated to achieve better outcomes<br>By understanding what governments value, acting with integrity and keeping commitments, we improve the chance they will allow us to earn good profit by creating value in society<br><br><br><b>Principles in Brief: Requirements for Human Action</b><br>For organization to succeed long term we must enable employees to understand what we are trying to achieve and empower them to achieve it in a principled manner. Bringing about this beneficial result requires an understanding of what causes people to act.<br><br>In his book, “Human Action,” noted economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises provides that understanding. He posits that three requirements must be met for individuals to take action:<br>1)  unease or dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs,<br>2)  a vision of a better state, and<br>3)  a belief that they can reach the better state.<br><br>For example, we mow our lawns only when we are dissatisfied with their present condition, believe they will look better and know how to mow them. Customers switch to organization when they become dissatisfied with their current supplier, believe we will serve them better and are able to switch.<br><br>Organizations that fail to meet these three requirements develop a culture that stifles progress.  In contrast, successful organizations: 1) create dissatisfaction with the status quo, 2) provide a vision of long-term success and fulfillment, and 3) empower employees to contribute by building a culture of Principled Entrepreneurship™.<br><br>We strive to create dissatisfaction with the current state by helping employees recognize that no matter how well they and the company are doing, unless they continually improve and transform themselves, creative destruction will ultimately cause us to become obsolete.<br><br>We help employees develop a vision of a better state, first by understanding their organization’s and organization’s vision and our principle-based framework, then by demonstrating that they will be better off if they more fully apply this framework to advance these visions.<br><br>The most difficult requirement is helping employees believe they have a path to a better state. For many companies, satisfying this requirement becomes impossible because they have developed a bureaucracy-based framework and culture that stifles employees’ ability to fully contribute.<br><br>We learned of one such situation directly from an officer at a major company. He said it was hopeless. They were stymied by bureaucracy, red tape and resistance to change. When asked what he was doing about it, he responded: “After a while you just paint your ass white and run with the antelope!” He and most others had given up. This happens when once-successful companies rest on their laurels and become complacent, self-protective and stagnant. When they do, employees have no path to a better state and decline sets in.<br><br>To overcome this tendency, our principle-based framework empowers our employees to reach a better state by motivating them to maximize their contribution to their organization’s and organization’s long-term success. This entails ensuring they have meaningful work that fits their talents and passions, have appropriate control over their activities, are able to develop and grow, have the opportunity to be creative and receive meaningful rewards.<br><br><br><b>Principles in Brief: Life of Meaning and Synergy</b><br>Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, believed that we all need “the striving and struggling for some worthy goal…the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled.  . . . That the more one forgets himself – by giving himself to a cause to serve, or another person to love – the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.”<br><br>While imprisoned, he learned that even when experiencing great difficulty, we have the power to choose our response. He gave the example of “men who walked through [the concentration camp] comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.” Those who did so had a better chance of surviving, because it gave them a reason to live. Frankl also taught that when people have no meaning in their lives, they default to the destructive paths of power or pleasure.<br><br>Psychologist Abraham Maslow believed that this pursuit of meaning is a deeply personal journey because everyone differs in their aptitudes, interests, goals, experiences and circumstances. We increasingly self-actualize as we learn about ourselves – what we care about as well as what we are and are not good at.  This better enables us to contribute and succeed, and help others do the same.<br><br>In Maslow’s view, we most fully self-actualize when we can achieve what he called synergy by resolving the “dichotomy between selfishness and unselfishness…when by pursuing [our] own self-interest, [we] automatically benefit everyone else, whether [we] mean to or not.” He believed it was possible for societies and organizations to create these conditions.<br><br>Maslow and Frankl found that people prefer meaningful work to meaningless work. Studies have found some janitors to be among the most self-actualized hospital employees. Those in hospitals that enable them to understand how they contribute to the well-being of patients and the smooth functioning of the hospital can experience deep satisfaction and meaning in their work. Similarly, Maslow explained that "washing the dishes can be the most meaningless chore or it can be a symbolic act of love for one’s family.” Thus, what’s important is not the nature of the work itself but our understanding of its purpose and who it is helping.<br>As employees, we find greater meaning in our work when we understand how it contributes to improving other people’s lives and the overall success of the company.  Feedback, recognition and rewards help us understand what is valued by others, thereby enabling ourselves and others to experience greater synergy, and our organization and society to experience greater success.<br><br><br><b>Mutual Benefit</b><br><b>What is Mutual Benefit?</b><br>This principle guides us to take a win-win approach in all we do. It goes beyond a simple transaction that benefits both parties – it's a proactive mindset that causes us to seek out relationships and opportunities where we can succeed by benefiting others. When we do this while consuming fewer resources, our profit is a result of benefiting our customers and society. This principle also guides us to avoid situations where one party benefits at the expense of others (win-lose).<br><br><b>Why is it important?</b><br>Mutual benefit is foundational to the role of business in society and organization’s Vision. It is the only way to succeed long-term. That is why we pursue mutually beneficial relationships with all core constituencies – employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities and governments. We seek to understand what they value and then cooperate with them to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Trust is the foundation for such relationships.<br><br><b>Principle in Brief: Mutual Benefit</b><br>In 1776, Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith observed that people in a civilized society always require the cooperation and assistance of others.  We obtain what we need by providing others with what they want. This simple idea, which today we call mutually beneficial exchange, when widely practiced, has lifted much of the world’s population out of poverty and subsistence.<br><br>Mutual benefit is foundational to the role of business in society and organization’s Vision. We seek to understand the needs of our constituencies, starting with providing products and services our customers value more than their alternatives. When we do this while consuming fewer resources, our profit is a result of benefiting our customers and society.<br><br>Some people believe that exchange is zero-sum – for one side to win, the other side must lose. This can be the case – such as when one party benefits at the expense of the other party through involuntary extraction. Whether legal (government bailouts, subsidies, mandates and tariffs) or illegal (fraud and theft), these win-lose approaches are always harmful to society.<br><br>Exchange is a positive-sum endeavor when it is voluntary and mutually beneficial. Both parties cooperate to get more of what they value and will only transact if both believe it will make them better off. This win-win approach respects each party’s right to choose whether or not to transact.  It is the only way to ensure value and good profit are created.<br><br>When companies are allowed to profit through extraction and exploitation, they avoid the constructive competitive pressure to innovate and create value for others. When companies can only profit through voluntary cooperation, they have a strong incentive to innovate and anticipate ways of satisfying customers.<br><br>At organization we strive to apply a win-win philosophy in all we do. That is why we pursue mutually beneficial relationships with all core constituencies – employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities and governments. We seek to understand what they value and then cooperate with them to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Trust is the foundation for such relationships.<br><br>Contribution-motivated employees are essential to applying a philosophy of mutual benefit. They are collaborative, build trusted relationships and make those they work with better.<br><br><br><b>Examples</b><br>Part of applying mutual benefit is looking for win-win situations and avoiding win-lose situations.<br><br><b>Win-Win</b><br>Supplier X shares our vision for creating value, understands our priories, and provides superior service. We pay Supplier X about 5% more than our next best alternative.<br><br>Although Greta’s supervisor, Vance, values having her on his team, he encourages Greta to pursue a role in another Koch company that will allow Greta to expand her skills and contribution.<br><br><b>Win-Lose</b><br>Theo works below his abilities so he won’t be asked to do more.<br><br>To hit their quarterly sales goals, a salesperson misrepresents the features of a new product to the customer.</td></tr>

Communicate with each team member so they understand how they earned their compensation and can increase it by contributing more.<br><br><br><b>Transformation</b><br><b>Our Value: Transformation</b><br><b>Transform yourself and help the company and others to do the same. Develop the visions, strategies, capabilities, products and services that will enable us to satisfy unmet needs and create superior value.</b><br><br><b>What is Transformation?</b><br>Transformation doesn’t mean doing what we’ve been doing a little better or faster. It means doing things in entirely new ways, such as: creating new and better products and services, using new technology, combining existing methods and technologies in new ways, significantly reducing the resources consumed and eliminating unprofitable activities.<br><br><b>Why is this important?</b><br>Transformation is one of Our Values because if we do not continually transform, we will become obsolete and fail. No matter how well we (as a company or individuals) are performing today, we must transform at a greater rate than current and future competitors. This is only possible in an entrepreneurial culture where employees drive transformation from the bottom up rather than waiting for a top-down grand plan.<br><br><b>Principles in Brief: Transformation</b><br>Not only is our world rapidly changing, the rate of change is accelerating. We have long emphasized the importance of continuous improvement; however, today we need more than that. We need continual transformation which requires a heightened sense of urgency. If we do not continually transform, creative destruction and entropy will overwhelm us, and we will fail.<br><br>Transformation doesn’t mean doing what we’ve been doing a little better or a little faster. It means doing things in entirely new ways, such as:  creating new and better products and services, using new technology, combining existing methods and technologies in new ways, significantly reducing the resources consumed and eliminating unprofitable activities. None of these happen without employees who are contribution motivated.  For every innovation there is an innovator – and likely many contributors. For every improvement there are employees with the initiative, ideas and skills to make it happen.<br><br>Transformation also requires building knowledge networks to inform us of methods, technologies and trends from anywhere in the world that might improve, disrupt or destroy what we do today. These knowledge-sharing networks, both internal and external, along with reality-based measures and well-designed experiments, are critical to achieving the necessary rate of transformation. If we are protectionist and close ourselves off from competition or innovation we will become obsolete.<br><br>Transformations only come about if we transform ourselves. This starts with a willingness to undergo the most difficult and painful of all changes: changing our paradigms. Developing new paradigms and habits based on principles of human progress involves focused and prolonged effort. Consider what’s required for a bodybuilder to transform into a marathon runner. Long-term success also entails continually seeking help to acquire new knowledge and skills. Being a lifelong learner is essential.<br><br>Our organization is transformed when we continually develop and update its vision, strategies, capabilities, products and services to create superior value and satisfy unmet needs. This is only possible in an entrepreneurial culture where employees are eager and willing to drive transformation from the bottom up rather than waiting for a top-down grand plan. While some transformations are big leaps forward, many are the cumulative result of employees continually challenging and pushing themselves and their teams to find new ways to create value.<br><br>Organization’s transformations have always depended on employees who are contribution motivated – who know that no matter how well we (as a company or individuals) are performing today, we can always do better. If we dedicate ourselves to understanding and applying the principles of human progress to continually transform ourselves and our organizations, we can accomplish more and have better lives than we ever imagined.<br><br><br><b>Examples</b><br>Here are some examples of what transformation can look like for individuals and the organization.<br><br><b>Transform Yourself</b><br>Barry has been a welder for 25 years. A few years ago, he learned how to weld using robot-assisted technology. Now he is learning to program these robots. Barry hopes that one day welders won't ever need to work in dangerous environments.<br><br>Ren’s team is not getting the results they would like. After talking to a mentor and her supervisor, Ren realizes she overly relies on rules and processes to lead her team. With their help, she works hard to change her leadership paradigm. She strives to lead with principles and especially focuses on how she provides feedback to her team. Instead of providing detailed instructions, she discusses goals, gives them principles to consider and asks them for their ideas.<br><br><b>Help Others Transform</b><br>As Barry has been learning more about robotic welding, he's also learned how people can work with other computer-assisted technologies. When Louanne tells him about a new quality testing technology, he brings along other team members to help them learn as they explore its possibilities.<br><br>As Ren focuses on providing quality feedback, she identifies knowledge gaps of each team member. Some are so used to taking directives that they are uncomfortable using judgment. Ren is now helping them develop knowledge and critical thinking skills so they can apply principles to make decisions. Over time, Ren notices the team is getting better results and is encouraged by their development.<br><br><b>Help the Company Transform</b><br>Barry continues to work with his supervisor and others to determine if they can use robot-assisted or drone technology for machine inspections. They are striving to make inspections safer with minimal interruptions to production.<br><br>Ren's team is performing much better. As they have embraced the principles of mutual benefit and Principled Entrepreneurship, they have developed new ways to meet their objectives—including a transformative way to process customer orders. It's been a win for Ren, her team members, customers and the company.<br><br><br><b>Headwinds and Tailwinds</b><br><b>What is the Headwinds and Tailwinds principle?</b><br>This principle helps us understand the powerful, sustained factors that affect the competitive landscape. Headwinds can destroy demand, intensify competitive forces and/or increase costs. Tailwinds can increase demand, weaken competitive forces and/or lower costs. It’s important to remember that headwinds or tailwinds are not temporary conditions.<br><br><b>Why is it important?</b><br>Applying this principle helps our businesses transform their ability to succeed in a variety of environments by modifying visions and strategies and building or strengthening capabilities. It also helps us make good decisions about entering, exiting or remaining in a business.<br><br><b>Principle in Brief: Headwinds and Tailwinds</b><br>We have long emphasized the importance of continually improving to drive rather than be a victim of the increasing rate of creative destruction. But in recent years, as the speed and magnitude of these changes accelerated, a heightened sense of urgency was required to not only improve but transform our performance. This led our businesses and capability groups to apply the concept of headwinds and tailwinds to transform their ability to succeed in a variety of environments by modifying their visions and strategies and building the required capabilities.<br><br>Headwinds exist for a product where its long-term opportunities and profitability are being seriously eroded by declining demand or a reduction in the barriers to entry. These winds can be generated by, among other things, competition from new technologies or products, unfavorable changes in consumer preferences or government interventions.<br><br>Tailwinds exist for a product where its long-term profitability has the potential to greatly increase. These winds can be generated by, among other things, new technologies, products or strategies, favorable changes in customer preferences or distortive government subsidies and mandates.<br><br>Wherever a headwind or tailwind exists it creates competitive forces in the opposite direction. The effects of headwinds are lessened by negative factors, such as those listed above, which deter new entrants, investments and innovations. The effects of tailwinds are lessened by stimulating a flood of new competitors, investments and innovation.<br><br>The headwinds/tailwinds model we developed for entering or remaining in a business, based on whether we have or can build the right capabilities for whatever conditions exist, has been a major factor in our recent successes.<br><br><br><b>Examples</b><br>Notice how these examples are all powerful, sustained factors that affect the competitive landscape.<br><br><b>Headwinds</b><br>The creation and popularity of smartphones created headwinds for companies that made things like standalone music devices (ex: MP3 players), watches, alarm clocks, and landline phones/services.<br>As casual clothes have become more acceptable in many facets of our lives, companies that make more formal wear face headwinds because of this change in consumer demand.<br>As electric vehicles have become more popular and favored by government policy, manufacturers of combustion engines and automobile parts are facing headwinds.<br><br><b>Tailwinds</b><br>The creation and popularity of smartphones created tailwinds for companies with online, self-service capability – such as online banking and video streaming.<br>As casual clothes have become more acceptable in many facets of our lives, companies that make casual clothes have experienced tailwinds.<br>As electric vehicles have become more popular and favored by government policy, manufacturers of batteries and electric components and systems are experiencing tailwinds.</td></tr>

You are held accountable for your responsibilities. Examples include products, services, assets, activities, employees, projects, systems, and processes.<br><br><b>EXPECTATIONS</b> focus on the desired outcomes rather than on the activities that might be required to produce those outcomes. They should be clear, specific, and, whenever possible, measurable.<br><br><b>A Principle-Based Approach</b><br>It is important to understand the principles that inform our approach to RREs.

Here are a few examples of RRE conversations.<br><br><b>Changes in Vision or Priorities</b>: Ari’s supervisor recently explained how their business strategy is changing from a regional support model to a national support model. In a one-on-one meeting, Ari describes how he sees his responsibilities changing – including dropping one that is no longer a priority. Ari’s supervisor agrees, and they spend the rest of the meeting exploring what good looks like.<br><br><b>Someone Leaves the Team</b>: Evelyn supervises the marketing team. An employee recently left the team, so Evelyn talks to each team member about how they might adjust their responsibilities. Each shares new responsibilities they want to take on and responsibilities they want to de-prioritize or give up completely. Evelyn takes time to consider everyone’s input and then works with each to adjust their RREs.<br><br><b>Too Much Work</b>: Remi’s work seems to come in waves – he's either slightly overwhelmed or completely overwhelmed. He talks to his supervisor about it, and she is surprised to learn how much Remi is doing when things are busy. Together they discuss different ways to smooth out the workload. While this is just the beginning of an ongoing conversation, Remi is pleased they’re working together to address it.<br><br><b>Too Little Work</b>: Fern gets done with her primary tasks quickly and is ready to do more, so she talks to her supervisor about taking on more responsibilities. They discuss various ideas, including a few stretch assignments, and decide to get back together next week after Fern considers what she is most interested in trying.<br><br><b>How Are RREs Related to Other Aspects of Employee Development?</b><br>RREs are one aspect of employee development—because each of us can develop through the work we are doing.
